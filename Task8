In this task you have to construct class diiagram for
your team project. You will show it during practice hour
with your team. If some of your team members absent, 
he won't get any point (unless he has permission).

You can see example in file 'diagram.jpg' attached.
This example is for 'Snake' game. You can see classes
with some methods and attributes. You should something
similar, and on practice you will explain it. for ex:

In 'snake' game, we will have several types of Food:
Temporary (after small amount of time they will disappear),
LoosingValue (each second value decreases), Moving (type
of food that moves). To do so, we create interfaces for each
of types, and one common interface for Food. We create 
Food using Factory method pattern, which will give us random
food. ...... .  GameController will work as Facade Pattern.
Here we create several classes, and in initiateGame method
we call functions from these classes...
